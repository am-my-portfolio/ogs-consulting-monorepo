        selected by the <strong> AAA</strong>. Any such arbitration may only be
        commenced within one (1) year after the party requesting arbitration
        obtains knowledge of the cause of action forming the basis of the
        controversy or claim accrued.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        In any arbitration and subject to the ultimate discretion of the
        presiding arbitrator, each side will be limited to a maximum of one (1)
        day of argument (including rebuttal), and the parties agree in good
        faith to minimize discovery burden (e.g. confine the scope to actual
        areas in dispute and limit the topics and number of pages on which
        information is requested to matters directly relevant). The decision(s)
        of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and may not be appealed to
        any court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, except upon claim of
        fraud or corruption as by law provided, however, that implementation of
        such decision(s) shall in no way be delayed or otherwise impaired
        pending the outcome of any such appeal. Judgment upon the award rendered
        in such arbitration may be entered by any court having jurisdiction
        thereof. You agree that all disputes will be limited between you,
        individually, and
        <strong> Circle Locker</strong>. To the full extent allowable by law,
        you agree that no arbitration proceeding, or other dispute resolution
        proceeding shall be joined with any other party or decided on a
        class-action basis.
      </p>
      <p className="my-4">
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that the following matters
        shall not, at the election of <strong> Circle Locker</strong>, be
        subject to binding arbitration: (1) any disputes related to, or arising
        from allegations of criminal activity; (2) any disputes concerning
        <strong> Circle Locker</strong>'s intellectual property rights; and (3)
        any claim for injunctive relief. Any dispute not subject to arbitration
        shall be decided by the state or federal court located within
        <strong> Bergen County, Colorado, United States of America</strong>.
        Each party hereby waives any claim that such a venue is improper or
        inconvenient.
        <strong>
          YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM,
          ACTION, OR PROCEEDING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING OUT OF, OR
          RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
          YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO
          SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
