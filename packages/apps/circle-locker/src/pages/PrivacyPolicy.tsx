        4. How Circle Locker Uses Information
      </h2>
      <p className="my-4">
        <strong> Circle Locker</strong> may process personal information
        relating to you if one of the following applies:
      </p>
      <ul className="ml-6 list-disc list-inside">
        <li className="space-y-4">
          You have given your consent to <strong> Circle Locker</strong> for one
          or more specific purposes. Under some legislations,
          <strong> Circle Locker</strong> may be allowed to process Personal
          Information until you object to such processing (
          <strong> "opt-out"</strong>), without having to rely on consent or any
          other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply,
          whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European
          data protection law, where you must explicitly agree to the processing
          of your Personal Information.
        </li>
        <li className="space-y-4">
          Provision of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of
          an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
          thereof;
        </li>
        <li className="space-y-4">
          Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
          which
          <strong> Circle Locker</strong> is subject;
        </li>
        <li className="space-y-4">
          Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
          <strong> Circle Locker</strong>;
        </li>
        <li className="space-y-4">
          Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
          pursued by <strong> Circle Locker</strong> or by a third-party.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="my-4">
        In any case, <strong> Circle Locker</strong> will gladly help to clarify
        the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
        particular whether the provision of personal information is a statutory
        or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a
        contract.
      </p>

          commenting, database management, e-commerce, payment processing – that
          require the handling of personal information. Some of these services
          work through geographically distributed servers, making it difficult
          to determine the actual location where the personal information is
          stored.
        </li>
        <li className="space-y-4">
