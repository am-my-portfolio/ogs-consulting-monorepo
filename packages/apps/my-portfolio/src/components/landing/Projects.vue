      <template #description>
        I specialize in building secure, multi-tenant SaaS platforms, with
        fine-grained RBAC üîê and user management baked in from day one. My go-to
        stack includes TypeScript, Vue.js, React/Next.js, NestJS, Postgres,
        Auth0, with Render and/or Cloudflare for deployment ‚öôÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è - everything
        needed to ship a robust, investor-ready MVP without over-engineering and
        complex infra and DevOps needs.
