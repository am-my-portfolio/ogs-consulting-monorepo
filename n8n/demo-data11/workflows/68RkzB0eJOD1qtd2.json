Pain. And purpose.\nAt my last job, I watched my entire team—my friends, my colleagues—get laid off, one by one. Then it was my turn. It deeply affected me. I was heartbroken—not just for myself and my teammates, but for the way it happened, the bad decisions which led to that, the over-promise, under-deliver pattern.\nBut I don’t want to feel like that ever again, and this is my way of transforming that experience. I’m choosing to grow, to persevere, and to build. Doing projects like this keeps me productive, focused, and resilient. It pulls me out of stagnation and into action. It replaces helplessness with ownership—and despair with creativity.\n🌱 I’m building something that lasts. Something I control. To stand tall in uncertain economies and prove—to myself, and maybe to others—that resilience is more than a mindset. It’s showing up. It’s taking action. It’s doing the work.\n📣 So I’m building a product.\u000b📣 I’m building a business.\u000b📣 I’m building me.\nIt’s scary. But it’s real. And it’s mine.\nIf you’ve been through some—I see you.\u000bLet’s survive and thrive—together.\n#Resilience #BuildInPublic #SoloFounder #OGS #ComebackStory #LayoffsToLeadership #PropertyTech #FounderJourney #WomenInTech #VerticalAI\n\n\nPost as OGS: What is the shift?\n🔥 The Big Shift: From SaaS to Agentic Platforms\nIn the traditional SaaS model:\u000b 🖥️ Users log in\u000b 📊 Navigate dashboards\u000b 🧩 Input data\u000b 🔄 Manually run workflows\nIn the agentic model:\u000b 🤖 You delegate to an AI agent\u000b 🧠 It understands your intent\u000b 🛠 Executes complex workflows behind the scenes\u000b ✅ Delivers outcomes—or asks for clarification\n\nThis changes everything:\n✨ Users don’t want dashboards.

It’s not just helping us use software,  👉🏽 It’s replacing the traditional software experience altogether.\nWe’re moving from UI-driven interactions—dashboards, forms, buttons—\u000bto agentic experiences, where intelligent agents understand intent, automate workflows, and deliver outcomes directly.\nBut here’s the paradox:\n🛠️ The architectural backbone of SaaS— secure multi-tenancy, data isolation, permissioning, auditability, workflow orchestration— is more important than ever.\nWe’re not abandoning SaaS.
