- got to use Facebook Login for Business
- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages-api/overview
- got to use the Business App type

- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard/app-types/

- user connect their facebook via my integrations page
- that gives me a User Token
- my code then use the User Token to request a Page token

- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens

- once i have the page id and page access token, then use the FB pages api
- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages-api/getting-started
- long lived page access token :
- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/get-long-lived
- its a bit confusing that long lived token doesnt expire, but it still has a `Data Access Expires` which is `in about 3 months`
- actually, as long as requests are made regularly with that token, it stays active
- If no requests are made, the token will expire after about 60 days and the person will have to go through the login flow again to get a new token.

- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages-api/posts

- once the long term page access token is acquired, then create a credential in n8n
- that credential is used in the n8n workflow

Draft:

- Manual stuff
